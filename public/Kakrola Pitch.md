# The Problem with Today's Work

Remember when work felt simpler? Now we're drowning in a sea of apps. Your team's important conversations are scattered across email, Slack, and WhatsApp. That crucial document? It could be in Google Docs, Notion, or someone's desktop. And don't even get started on where all the tasks are hiding.

Every day, your team wastes precious time just trying to find stuff. The constant app-switching is killing their focus. And you? You're spending more time checking if work is happening than actually moving things forward.
